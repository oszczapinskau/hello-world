### My CS100 journey
This repository was created as part of the **first** laboratory assignment for CS100. This is my first time taking a formal, and structured computer science class. My interesting in taking a computer science class stemmed from participating in an undergraduate research program that emphasized the use of various programs, and implementing data science into psychology.
